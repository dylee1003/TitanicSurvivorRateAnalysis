TitanicSurvivorRateAnalysis
===========================

Data analysis on survivor rate in Titanic disaster by using Python and R.

The raw data set was downloaded from Kaggle, the data mining competition platform. I mainly used Python to conduct data processing for the raw dataset. Then I conducted data analysis on the processed data by using R and Python.

Codes are stored in the iPython Notebook in the repository. Titanic Project Proposal describes the goal and methods I applied in the analysis, while Titanic Project Report provides more detail analysis such as classification tree and logistic regression on the survivor rate in Titanic disaster.

Thank you for reading and feel free to give me suggestions.
